# PicartoLive.py
This script will generate static icons that will display the status of picarto streams for embedding in web pages that only allow linking to static resources.

Simply add the channel name to the URLs fileand that stream will be added to the list of streams to update. This script is best run on a cron job so that it updates the status images automatically.
